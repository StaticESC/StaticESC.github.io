                <!-- TODO: Make this more readable -->
                Hey, my name is Jyotirmay Shelly and welcome to my web-portfolio! I am a third-year CS student at the University of Alberta. I am currently <b>open to work</b>, seeking tech-related internships.<br><br>

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                My main interest is in Software development, with specific interests in 
                Low-level network development, Embedded development, Web Development, Mobile Development, and Application Development. I also have prior experience in the aforementioned fields. <br><br>

                Furthermore, I have a great interest in programming language design and implementation. I believe that knowing how a language is designed (and implemented) -- hence knowing whether it is compiled, requires a runtime, is garbage collected, knowing its underlying memory management model, its type system, etc -- can greatly boost the programmer's efficiency and also lead to some rather insightful considerations.
                After learning Rust (I love to program in Rust) I learned a lot not just about Rust but also about other programming languages. I realized that, as programmers, we often take a lot for granted (like which Data structure to use, whether the language requires a runtime, etc) which can have great implications when designing code for scalability or when working under constrained environments (like embedded systems). Incorporating these considerations also lets one know when to <i>not</i> worry about these things.
                <br><br>

                I also love open source software. As a Linux and (neo)vim user for the past two years, I have gained great appreciation for open source software. I have also made my own contributions to the open source community. <br><br>

                <h3>Principles/Paradigms</h3>
                I believe what separates a good programmer from a great programmer is the set of principles they believe in. Kent Beck, the creator of 'Extreme Programming' once said “I’m Not a Great Programmer, I’m Just a Good Programmer With Great Habits.”.  Although I agree to a multitude of different programming paradigms/principles, I like to give particular attention to some, like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Functional programming: Writing code which is functionally pure, with minimized side effects, however not at a cost to performance.</li>
                    <li>Leveraging Strong typed Languages: Choosing, when possible, languages which have a strong type system. However, not-strongly typed languages in many cases make sense. (like rapid development, scripting, etc)</li>
                    <li>Safe: Writing code which is safe, as in all possible "states" or "routes" of failure are accounted for.</li>
                    <li>Performance Oriented: When talking about "systems-at-scale", performance is key. It is always beneficial to consider performance when choosing the tech-stack.
                </ul>
                Being a person of strong principles is fine, but I think it is often more important to be pragmatic, hence I also believe in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Being pragmatic: Sometimes, for the sake of simplicity, lack of scalability, or time, it is fine to not meet all expectations. However, there is always a balance. It would be better to reach deadlines rather than being a perfectionist, however, one should still strive for perfection!</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Programming Experience:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Java: I have a very good grasp of Java, OOP, and design patterns. I have used Java to create a Multiplayer Android QR Hunting game in a team based environment.</li><br>
                    <li> C/C++: I have used C/C++ in compiler development. I have also used C/C++ in a systems programming class where I used it for the following: Interprocess communication (using FIFOs, pipes, sockets), multithreading, TCP communication over sockets, process synchronization (using concurrency primitives like semaphores, mutexes, etc). </li><br>
                    <li> Rust: Rust is my favourite programming language and I am still learning it. I have over 1 year of experience in programming in Rust. I have implemented the Snake game on a microcontroller using Rust (embedded development). I am also currently working on making a multiplayer terminal based client server uno game implementation in Rust.</li><br>
                    <li> Python: I have over 5 years of experience in python programming. I have experience with PyGame and using it in a OOP manner.  I also have experience in integrating SQLite and MongoDB to create simple terminal based database management interfaces.</li><br>
                    <li> C#: I have extensively used C# and Unity for 2D game development. I also have a good grasp of OOP in C#. </li><br>
                    <li> HTML/CSS/JS: I am currently learning full-stack web development and will soon be learning different JavaScript frameworks.</li><br>
                    <li> Julia: I have some experience in programming in Julia in context of machine learning. I have used Julia to create and evaluate models. </li><br>
                    <li> RISC-V ASM: I learned Risc-V assembly in my 'computer organization and architecture' class in University.</li><br>
                </ul>
