> ### **This website is a work-in-progress. Please let me know of any bugs!**

Hey there, Welcome to my website! Head over to [About Me](about) to learn more about me!

I intend to use this website as a means to document/write about my professional and personal life, the projects I work on, my opinions on stuff, my workflow, and just about anything. 

If you would like to reach out to me, my contacts should be at the footer of the webpage.
